**7.2 Indicator: Chlorophyll Concentration**

Phytoplankton are the foundation of the marine food web. Their abundance affects food availability for
all consumers, ranging from zooplankton to apex predators. Chlorophyll concentration is used as a proxy
for phytoplankton abundance. Some climate change projections suggest a shift towards lower
phytoplankton abundances, particularly in the ocean’s oligotrophic gyres. Chlorophyll concentration
(and phytoplankton abundance) varies greatly across the Pacific basin, with higher concentrations
generally found at higher latitudes and particularly around coastlines. Chlorophyll concentrations also
vary in response to natural climate variability.
Chlorophyll-a concentration is estimated from satellite remotely sensed observations of ocean color,
which extend back to 1998. The basin-wide average (1998 – 2021) is shown below. The Palau EEZ is also
highlighted as a spatial average (1998 – 2021) and a time series averaged over this area. No significant
trend in chlorophyll concentration was detected over this region and time span.
